      In order to get cw completion, 
        [bash] you need to install `bash-completion` with brew.
        OR
        [zsh], add the following line to your ~/.zshrc:
          source #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh/site-functions/_cw
      EOS
  end

    run_output = shell_output("#{bin}/cw --help 2>&1")
